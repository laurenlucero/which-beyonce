## Overview
Which Beyoncé? is a memory matching card game that I built with a team during module 1 of 4 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).
Each player takes turn flipping over two cards at a time. 
If they match, that player “scores”. 
If the two cards don’t match, they must be flipped back over. 
The goal is the get the greatest amount of matches.
