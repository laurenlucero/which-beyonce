## Overview
Which Beyoncé? is a memory matching card game built with two other front end developers during module 1 of 4 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).
Each player takes turn flipping over two cards at a time. 
If they match, that player “scores”. 
If the two cards don’t match, they must be flipped back over. 
The goal is the get the greatest amount of matches in the shortest time.
