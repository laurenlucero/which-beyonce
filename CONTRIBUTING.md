What does it take to be an open source contributor? Just a GitHub account, some git commands, curiosity, patience, and kindness. If this is your first ever open source contribution, read [Your first open source contribution: a step-by-step technical guide](https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6) for more details to get started.

## 1. View Issues
- To contribute to this project, go to the Issues section of the repo to find an issue to work on.
- Issues range from bug fixes to documentation to new features. Look at "good first issue" or "help wanted" tags to start.
- Comment on an Issue that you want to help with any questions before you start coding.
- You can also submit a bug report or feature request by clicking New issue.

## 2. Make and download your copy
- Fork the repository to make a copy of the project to work from.
- Clone the fork to download to your local machine.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## 3. Make a git branch
- Use command `git-checkout-b` with a descriptive name for your branch that summarizes the issue you are working on.

## 4. Do the work!
- When you have some code that you want to keep, save it in git by creating a commit.
- Run the tests (if there are any), if tests fail fix your code or the test.

## 5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
- When you have work that is ready for review to add to the project, notify the project maintainers by requesting they pull your changes in.
- Go to your fork of the project, click on the Pull Requests tab and the New Pull Request button.
- The "base fork" should automatically be the main project and master branch.
- In the "compare" dropdown, choose the branch name you were working on.
- Fill out the pull request template for the maintainers to review.
- Leave the box checked that says "allow edits from maintainers" and click Create Pull Request to finish making the PR.
